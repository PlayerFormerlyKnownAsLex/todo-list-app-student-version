Lex's TODO List

1. Purpose
   
This is my final project for my Data and Design Course, meant to utilize frontend, middleware, and backend, as well as several different    programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as showcasing the ability to identify errors and successfully debug them.
